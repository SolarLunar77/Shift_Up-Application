	<td>Why are you a good fit for this program?</td>
	<td>I am a good fit for this program because I am diligent, resourceful, and analytical enough to succeed in Shift_Up and am able to communicate and collaborate well with other students in the program. Since I have worked in different industries before including research, administrative, museum, and educational, I love a good challenge and learning something new. I enjoy working with computers, writing code, and creating websites. Joining Shift_Up will grant me the opportunity to expand my skill set so that I can help companies, non-profits, and individuals achieve their visions in the online world.</td>
